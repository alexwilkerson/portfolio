          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>This paragraph is filler text. It is impermanent. I tried
          very little to make it interesting. As of this writing I believe I am a bipedal animal who is
          having the subject experience of billions of neurons firing
          simultaneously giving rise to the illusion of consiousness.
          I also have a computer on my lap. This website is where I share to
          a small audience the bits and bloops of my creative output. By
          the very nature of a portfolio, I feel I am an active
          participant in some weird narcissism. I will do my best to
          come to terms with this.</p>
